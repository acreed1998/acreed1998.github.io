    YO! Yeah, you! Get over here, I don’t have a lot of time. Yes, I’m a talking magpie. No, you’re not hallucinating. I’m going to give you a blessing and I need you to <b>not</b> immediately get hit by a goddamn car like the last featherbrain. Anyway, I’m going to make it quick- there’s always supposed to be a certain number of “legendary thieves” in the world and it’s my job to give them their abilities. The previous girl to get my blessing finally died in her sleep after rockin’ 16 total operations, so now I gotta give it to someone else. The only catch is that you <b>have</b> to use your skills and connections (yeah, I’ll introduce you to some peeps) to steal other people’s stuff.
    </p>
    <p class="narration">
    Hmm? Who was the previous thief? You wouldn’t know her – she spent the entire time making sure no one knew her identity and never spending what she stole. She lived in one of those shipping bin houses! Oh, did you mean the jagoff I tried doing this with ten minutes ago? Yeah no, he was just some bloke who happened to be in the right place at the right time, just like you; well, up until he suddenly wasn’t.
    </p>
    <p class="narration">
    Believe it or not, the world needs thieves – and now it’s time for you to be one. Do you want to be rich? Notorious? Prove yourself and you might end up both.

                Choosing this type means you’re in it for the fame and challenge, not the money. You’ll end up keeping the treasures you steal in your own personal gallery and never think of selling them. You’re also a bit of a loner but hey, who wants to share the limelight?

                The era of showmanship is over, and the best mask is anonymity. The trick is to have a well-executed plan that makes each member of the team “invisible” at all steps.

                <p>
                A good middle route for those who find the Master Thief silly and the Shock and Awe too crass, choosing this way means taking what you want and getting out before they realize who could have possibly done it. As a result, you never have any interest in the notoriety of your crimes.

                Blitzkrieg is an apt term – you’re just here for the money. You have a dozen different ways to get rid of the barriers between you and it, though most result in mass mayhem. Your style leaves too much risk to go after anything other than bonds or gold, though. You’re also a lot more reliant on having a well-balanced crew.
